# Movie Review Application

## Overview

This is an application that can help users keep track of the movies they have watched. Users can create personal
collection, and they can add or delete movies. Also, users are allowed to rate and comment on the movies they have
watched. Their ratings and reviews will be tracked, and they can view them later if they want.
